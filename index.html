<h1>Maldives dream holiday</h1>
<p>The Maldives is a fascinating country to travel to <em>independently</em>, not least because it’s only been possible
    to do so
    for the past decade. Now, guesthouses are springing up on local islands on a weekly basis, offering budget
    travellers an <strong>affordable</strong> way to explore the country.</p>

<h2>It can be done cheaply!</h2>

<p>The Maldives were always my dream honeymoon destination for a couple of reasons.

<ol>
    <li>It looked like it had the best beaches in the world</li>
    <li>The resorts were very expensive.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’d assumed that the Maldives was a once in a lifetime destination that I’d visit only for a very special occasion.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <em>Not true!</em>
</p>

<p>For $30-60 a night, you’ll receive an clean, modern, and spacious room with air conditioning, a hot shower, free
    breakfasts, snorkeling gear, a bottle of water each day, twice daily room cleaning[!], and fast Wi-Fi.</p>

<h2>Finding cheap transport</h2>

<p>Transport is also cheap. Local ferries run on a somewhat infrequent schedule but shouldn’t cost more than $2-4 for a
    three hour journey. We paid $0.60 for the ferry from Male Airport to Male, $3 for the ferry from Male to Maafushi,
    $4 for the ferry from Maafushi to Fulidhoo, and $2 for the ferry from Maafushi to Guraidhoo.
